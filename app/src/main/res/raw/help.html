  <h2>What is Metal Detector?</h2>
  <p>Metal Detector is an Android app that uses the magnetometer in your phone to detect metals. It is developed by the developer "AppEDit Mobile" and is designed to help you find metal objects that may be missing in the dark. </p>
  
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>The app uses the magnetometer in your Android phone to detect metal objects. The magnetometer measures the magnetic field around the phone and indicates the presence of metal. The app then gives you an indication of the presence and location of metal objects.</p>
  
  <h2>Does it work on all phones?</h2>
  <p>Not all Android phones have a magnetometer, so this app may not work on all devices. It is important to check your phone specifications to see if it has a magnetometer before installing the app.</p>
  
  <h2>Are the results 100% reliable?</h2>
  <p>The magnetometer in your Android phone is not specifically designed for detecting metals, and its sensitivity may be limited. As a result, the results of using this app may not be 100% reliable. It is important to keep in mind that this app should not be used to replace a real metal detector.</p>
  
  <h2>Who can use this app?</h2>
  <p>Anyone can use this app to help find metal objects that may be missing in the dark. However, it is important to keep in mind that the results may not be 100% reliable and should not be used as a substitute for a real metal detector.</p>
  
  <h2>Other useful information</h2>
  <p>Here are some other useful things to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The accuracy of the app may be affected by interference from other sources of magnetic fields.</li>
    <li>The app may not be able to detect small metal objects.</li>
    <li>It is important to calibrate the magnetometer in your phone before using the app for the first time.</li>
  </ul>
