  <h1>About Metal Detector</h1>
  <p>Metal Detector is a simple and intuitive app that uses the magnetometer in your Android phone to detect metals. With a user-friendly interface, this app makes metal detection accessible to anyone with a smartphone.</p>
  <p>Metal Detector was developed by AppEDit Mobile, a team of talented developers dedicated to creating innovative and useful mobile applications. If you have any questions or feedback about the app, please don't hesitate to contact the developer at <a href="mailto:appeditmobile@gmail.com">appeditmobile@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  <p class="disclaimer">Please note that this app is not meant to replace a real metal detector. The magnetometer in mobile phones is not powerful enough or specifically designed to detect metals, and thus the results obtained from this app may not be 100% reliable. However, it can still be used to find metal objects that are lost or missing in dark spaces.</p>
